# High-C
A bash script that lets you pass arguments from the command line to a C function parsed from a man page.

### Oh my god! That's so dangerous!!

I know. Please,

*If you a scared motherfucker* ***Go to church*** *Go to church*

*And **Seriously** Please, **DO NOT** Actually Use This.*

### Why would you do that?

I wrote a man page for another thing, and it was the most difficult programming challenge of the whole project.

... So I thought, "Hmm, try to make it easier to make manpages, realize it is an institution for a reason, and waste days when you have other things to do? Or I could add an incomprehensible, insane layer of insecurity and danger to my testing environment, for no reason, and laugh my ass of as tons of shit breaks for almost no perceptible reason..."

### What's wrong with you?

I know, I know... I'm super lazy. But hey, I got a lot on my plate. I'll add the script options to turn off CFLAGS, and use a random address when a function calls for a pointer as input later.

### Shiiiiit........ Okay fine whatever, but why would you call it High-C?

Well, you're calling *C functions*, which are pretty low layers of abstraction, from *shell scripts*, which are a somewhat "higher" layer of abstraction.... I'm.. Neh. That's not real. That's total bullshit. I'm sorry..

I ran through a pretty hefty list of names:

C-Shell (Taken)
She'll-Sell-C-Shells-by-the-C-Shore (Totally dumb)
C-NoEvil
C-Gulls
C-Notes
Emergen-C
C-Change
Stormy-C
Dead-C-Scripts
TheOldManAndThe-C
Murder-C-Wrote
He-Sed-C-Sed
wyCiwyg
Jui-C
and of course...

"SAGGI TITTIES"

**Such A GGood Idea Titties!**

...

So I settled on High-C, because it's less like a tool, and more like some bullshit your teenager and their fuck up friends play with when they're so high that they can't look at you, and you know their high, and they know you know their, but you can't say anything because it just isn't the time, it wouldn't get through, and you know that *your words* are not going to change *their behavior*, but you still feel it deep in your gut, you need them to know, that you know, and Arrrgghh. Why is it so difficult just for my kids to talk to me.

### You're fuckin' nuts guy.

Yeah well, I'm totally cool with it sounds like a personal problem. 

Seriously, don't use this. It's a joke, not a tool.
